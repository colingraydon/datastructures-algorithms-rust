## DS and Algo in rust

This repo contains a collection of implementations of common data structures and algorithms in rust. This is for learning purposes only and mostly for my own reference. None of the implementations are intended to be used in production code.

#### Data Structures

- [x] Vector
- [x] LinkedList
- [] Binary Search Tree
- [] B Tree
- [] Location Aware Hash Map
- [] Location Aware Priority Queue
